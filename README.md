# CPP_Linked_List
My amateur implementation of a Linked List in C++.

Supports:
 - Copy with itself
 - Initialization with initializer_list
 - Assignment with initializer_list
 - Iterator based functions such as range-based for loops and std::find()

Probably maybe possibly has a shallow copy issue. Perhaps.
